=====================================================================

This community-centered payment system is designed to provide greater local control of economics, so we can make our communities everything we want them to be.

The companion software project, Common Good POS, works very much like credit card processing apps for swipe cards. Except instead of a swipe card reader you use your smartphone's camera vision to scan a QR code on the customer's Common Good Card.

Set up instructions are located on Google Drive [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQU-PPown2TV02Xg9htxByzOhUopGH-areUrlZ94Te0/edit).
