Feature: FBO
AS a sponsored member company or administrator
I WANT to track payments to and from non-members
SO I can accept donations and make payments for a fiscally-sponsored organization.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName | phone        | address | city  | state  | zip | country  | postalAddr | floor | flags              | coFlags   | emailCode |*

  | .ZZC | .ZZB  | buy        |
  | .ZZC | .ZZA  | manage     |
  And these "tx_rules":
