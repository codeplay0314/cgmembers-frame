Feature: Offline
AS a company agent
I WANT to accept transactions offline
SO my company can sell stuff, give refunds, and trade USD for rCredits even when no internet is available

and I WANT those transactions to be reconciled when an internet connection becomes available again
SO my company's online account records are not incorrect for long.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName   | email | cc  | cc2  | floor | flags                | activated |*
