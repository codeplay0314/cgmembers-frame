Scenario: The app asks for recent transactions
  Given var "surtxs" is JSON:
  | amount | portion | crumbs | roundup |*1
  |      4 |    0.25 |      0 |    true |
  And var "txs" is JSON:
  | pending | extra   | xid | amount | accountId | name    | description | created |*
  |       1 |       0 |   0 |     45 | K6VMDCB   | Bea Two | lunch       | %now-7d |
  |         | -229.00 |   6 |   -900 | K6VMDCC   | Coco Co | theta       | %now-1d |
  |         |       0 |   5 |     78 | K6VMDCF   | For Co  | epsil       | %now-2d |
  |         |       0 |   4 |    -56 | K6VMDCB   | Bea Two | delta       | %now-3d |
#  |         |       0 |   1 |    -12 | L6VMDCC1  | Coco Co | alpha       | %now-6d |
  When app posts "info" with:
  | version | deviceId | actorId | count  |*
  | 400     | devA     | K6VMDCA | 3      |
  Then we reply "ok" with JSON values:
  | balance | surtxs  | txs  |*1
  | -119    | %surtxs | %txs |

Scenario: The app asks for recent transactions with a missing parameter
  When app posts "info" with:
  | version | deviceId | actorId |*
  | 400     | devC     | K6VMDCC |
  Then we reply "syntax" with: "?"

Scenario: The app asks for recent transactions with a bad actorId
  When app posts "info" with:
  | version | deviceId | actorId | count |*
  | 400     | devC     | K6VMDCX | 3     |
  Then we reply "unauth"

Scenario: The app asks for recent transactions with a bad count
  When app posts "info" with:
  | version | deviceId | actorId | count    |*
  | 400     | devC     | K6VMDCC | whatever |
  Then we reply "syntax" with: "?"

Scenario: The app asks for recent transactions with a count out of range
  When app posts "info" with:
  | version | deviceId | actorId | count  |*
  | 400     | devC     | K6VMDCC | -1     |
  Then we reply "syntax" with: "?"
