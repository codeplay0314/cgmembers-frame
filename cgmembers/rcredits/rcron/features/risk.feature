Feature: Risk
AS a Common Good Community Administrator or Member or Compliance Officer at a partnering financial institution
I WANT to know what financial or regulatory risks each account, transaction, and ACH pose
SO I can handle those risks appropriately

Setup:
  Given members:

  And riskThresholds:
  | Day | Week | 7Week | Year |*
  | 300 |  600 |  1200 | 2400 |

  When cron runs "trust"
  Then members have:
  | uid  | trust |*
  | .ZZA |  8.57 |
  | .ZZB |  8.57 |
  | .ZZD |  8.57 |

  | .ZZG |     1 |
  | .ZZH |     1 |
  | .ZZI |     1 |

Scenario: We calculate risks
  When cron runs "acctRisk"
  When cron runs "acctRisk"
  Then member ".ZZA" has risks "adminOk,trusted,badConx,moreOut,big7Week"
  And member ".ZZB" has risks "trusted,geography,moves,rents,moreIn,moreOut"
  And member ".ZZC" has risks "cashCo,homeCo,miser,bigDay,bigWeek,big7Week"
  And member ".ZZD" has risks "trusted,hasBank,miser"
  And member ".ZZE" has risks "new,shady,poBox,moreIn"
  And member ".ZZF" has risks "bigDay,bigWeek"
  And member ".ZZG" has risks "new,moves,badConx,addrOff"
  And member ".ZZH" has risks "moves,ssnOff"
  And member ".ZZI" has risks "new,moves,fishy"
#  | .ZZC | cashCo,homeCo,miser,bigDay | (this happens sometimes but is WRONG: 1270>1200 and 660>600)
# Do not specify exact risk because minor tweaks in the calculations cause major changes

  Given riskThresholdPercent is "10"
  When cron runs "acctRiskFinish"
  Then riskThresholds:
  | Day | Week | 7Week | Year |*
  | 621 |  621 |  1270 | 1570 |
#  | 330 |  340 |   635 |  785 |

  When cron runs "txRisk"
  Then these "txs":
