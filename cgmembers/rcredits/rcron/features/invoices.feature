Feature: Invoices
AS a member
I WANT to charge other members and pay invoices from other members (and unfunded payment requests from me) automatically at night, if necessary
SO I can buy and sell stuff.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName | bankAccount | floor | minimum | flags                           |*
  | .ZZA | Abe One  | USkk9000001 |  -250 |     500 | ok,confirmed,refill,debt,bankOk |
  | .ZZB | Bea Two  |             |  -250 |     100 | ok,confirmed,debt               |
  | .ZZC | Our Pub  |             |  -250 |       0 | ok,confirmed,co,debt            |
  | .ZZE | Eve Five | USkk9000005 |  -250 |     200 | bankOk                          |
  And members have:
  | uid  | staleNudge |*
  | .ZZC |          4 |
  And relations:
  | main | agent | permission |*
  | .ZZC | .ZZB  | buy        |

  Scenario: Unpaid invoices get handled
  Given members have:
  | uid  | floor | balance |*
  | .ZZA |     0 |     100 |
  And invoices:
  | nvid | created   | status       | amount | payer | payee | for   |*
  |    1 | %today    | %TX_APPROVED |    100 | .ZZA | .ZZC | one   |

  |    5 | %today-7d | %TX_PENDING  |    500 | .ZZA | .ZZC | five  |
  Then balances:
  | uid  | balance |*
  | .ZZA |     100 |
  | .ZZB |       0 |
  | .ZZC |       0 |
  
  When cron runs "getFunds"
  Then transactions: 
  | xid | created | amount | payer   | payee | purpose   | taking | type  |*
  |   1 | %today  |    100 | .ZZA    | .ZZC  | one       |        | prime |
  |   2 | %today  |      0 | bank-in | .ZZA  | from bank |      1 | bank  |
  And count "txs" is 2
  And count "txs2" is 1
  And count "tx_requests" is 5
  And these "txs2":
  | txid | payee | amount | created | completed | deposit |*
  |    1 | .ZZA  |    700 | %today  |         0 |       0 |
  And invoices:
  | nvid | created   | status       | amount | payer | payee | for   |*
  |    1 | %today    | 1            |    100 | .ZZA  | .ZZC  | one   |

  |    5 | %today-7d | %TX_PENDING  |    500 | .ZZA  | .ZZC  | five  |

  And we notice "short invoice|expect a transfer" to member ".ZZA" with subs:
  | short | payeeName | nvid |*
  | $200  | Our Pub   |    2 |
  And we notice "banked|bank tx number" to member ".ZZA" with subs:

  | draw   | from   | $200   |        2 | to pay pending payment request #2 |
  
  When cron runs "pendingRequests"
  Then we message "stale invoice" to member ".ZZA" with subs:
