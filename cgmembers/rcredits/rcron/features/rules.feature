Feature: Recurs
AS a member
I WANT my stepup or discount rules to repeat sometimes
SO I can have things recur in just the right way.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName  | flags            | balance |*
  | .ZZA | Abe One   | member           | 0       |
  | .ZZB | Bea Two   | ok,confirmed     | 500     |
  | .ZZC | Cor Pub   | ok,confirmed,co  | 0       |
  | .ZZF | Food Fund | ok,confirmed,co  | 0       |
  | .ZZG | Glo Co    | ok,confirmed,co  | 0       |
  | .ZZH | Hip Co    | ok,confirmed,co  | 0       |
  And these "u_groups":
  | id | name      |*
  | 1  | Food Fund |
  And these "u_groupies":
  | grpId | uid  |*
  | 1     | .ZZA |
  | 2     | .ZZB |
  And these "tx_timed":
  | id        | 1            | 2            | 3            | 4             | 5            |**

Scenario: Rules get instantiated
  When cron runs "recurs"
  Then these "tx_rules":

  And these "txs":

  # MariaDb bug: autonumber passes over id=2 when there are record ids 1 and -1
  And these "tx_requests":
  | nvid | created | amount | payer | payee | purpose | recursId |*
  |    1 | %today  |    123 | .ZZA  | .ZZC  | invoice | 4        |

Scenario: An ended template has no effect
  Given these "tx_timed":
  | id        | 6            |**
  | action    | pay          |

  When cron runs "recurs"
