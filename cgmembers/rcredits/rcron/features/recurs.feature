Feature: Recurs
AS a member
I WANT to make recurring payments (typically gifts) to other members
SO I can save on memory and labor.

Setup:
  Given members:
  | uid  | fullName | address | city  | state | zip   | country | postalAddr | flags               | bankAccount | floor |*
  | .ZZA | Abe One  | 1 A St. | Atown | AK    | 01000 | US      | 1 A, A, AK | ok,confirmed,bankOk | USkk9000001 |   -20 |
